          "content": "<h3>Mother’s Day – how it all began</h3><p><b>A.</b>\tNowadays, mother’s day celebrations are held thought-out the world though they do not fall at the same time. The way of celebrating may also differ but the purpose is the same. It is to honor the mother and to feel and cherish the beautiful bonds we share with her. It would be interesting to find out how the idea of Mother’s Day first took root and who its originator was.</p><p><b>B.</b>\tThe first celebrations were held in spring in ancient Greece, by paying tribute to Rhea, the “Mother of Gods”. During the 17th century, England honoured mother by celebrating “Mothering Sunday” on the fourth Sunday of Lent. In the United States, Julia Ward Home suggested the idea in 187 and perceived Mother’s Day as being dedicated to peace.</p><p><b>C.</b>\tBut it was Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia who brought about the official observance of Mother’s Day. She wanted this day to be a holiday and launched a campaign for it. This she did in memory of her mother who died in 1905and who had, in the late 19th century tried to establish ‘Mother’s Friendship Days’ as a way to heal the scars of civil war.</p><p><b>D.</b>\tIn 1907, Jarvis held a ceremony in Grafton, West Virginia, to honor her mother. The proceedings touched her so greatly that she began a massive campaign to adopt a formal holiday for honoring mothers and in 1910; West Virginia became the first State to recognize Mother’s Day. A year later, nearly every state officially marked the day. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially proclaimed Mother’s Day as a national holiday to be held on the second Sunday of May.</p><p><b>E.</b>\tBut all her efforts to make Mother’s day of sentiment and love proved futile when she found that the holiday had been commercialized. Her accomplishment then turned bitter for her. She fought against the commercialization of this day. She filed a law suit to stop a 1923 Mother’s Day. She was even arrested for disturbing the peace at a War Mother’s convention where women sold white carnations. White carnation was her symbol for mothers, helping her to raise money. She never intended this day to be one for profit making and that was exactly what it had become.</p>",
